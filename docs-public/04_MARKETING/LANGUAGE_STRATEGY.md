# Language Strategy (EN/ES) for the 4 Portals

Goal: keep the set complementary, reduce repetition, and match platform expectations.

## Recommended split

- Dev.to: **EN** (technical build + artifacts + reproducibility)
- HackerNoon: **EN** (story vibe but receipts-first; still global reach)
- LinkedIn: **EN** by default; optionally add a short **ES** recap at the end if your network is LATAM-heavy
- Medium/Substack: **ES** (manifesto + philosophy + explicit evidence/narrative boundary)

## Optional bilingual patterns

### LinkedIn bilingual (lowest effort)

Structure:
1) EN headline + 4 bullets
2) ES “Resumen” (3 bullets)
3) Link to Dev.to (technical) + Medium/Substack (Spanish longform)

### Medium/Substack: ES main + EN abstract

Add a short EN abstract (5–7 lines) at the top to improve discoverability.

## Consistency rules

- Use the same one-line disclaimer everywhere (see `IMAGES_PLAN.md`).
- Keep the same taxonomy words:
  - Evidence = `reports/` outputs
  - Narrative = `intelligence_reports/` and anything labeled simulated
- Avoid mixing metaphors with claims in the same sentence.
